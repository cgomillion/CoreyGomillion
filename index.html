    <h1>About Me</h1>
   
    <h4>I am a junior software engineer who intertwines creativness and intuitiveness to blend into any work environment. Having a strong background in sports I bring the team-atmosphere and comradery to my work environment. Continuing to expand my knowledge every day, “In any given moment we have two options: to step forward into growth or to step back into safety.” - Abraham Maslow</h4>


    <h1>My Projects</h1>

    <h3>Gomillion "G0,000,000" Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>This is a joint collaborative project / brand that my older sister, younger brother, and I have embarked on starting. We are all about pushing positive vibes and helping others. We speak for those who enjoy the grind, thrive under pressure, and Never Give Up! Why not be the change you want to see. These are the basis upon we are built and uphold our standards to. We Are Family. </p>

    <h3>MomMadeCustomTees</h3>
    <p>This was my Capstone project for my SEIR FLEX program, this is a Full MERN Stack program. This is an online retail store for my older sister. Since learing my new aquired skills I thought what better way to showcase them than trying to help my family progress. Stay tuned for more improvments in the next release! Built with Node.js, Javascript, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, React.js, React-bootstrap, Cors, Bcrypt, Dotenv, and Express-sessions. </p>
